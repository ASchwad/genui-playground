# Enhanced Multi-Query Web Search

## Overview

The agent now supports enhanced web search capabilities that can handle complex queries requiring multiple searches with intelligent planning. This addresses the limitation where the previous web search only worked for single queries at a time.

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Query Planning**
- Automatically analyzes complex queries and breaks them down into focused searches
- Uses GPT-4o to understand user intent and create optimal search strategies
- Handles time-series data, comparisons, and multi-faceted queries

### 2. **Multi-Search Execution**
- Executes multiple searches in sequence with progress tracking
- Manages API rate limits with appropriate delays between searches
- Handles errors gracefully with partial result recovery

### 3. **Result Synthesis**
- Combines results from multiple searches into coherent summaries
- Uses AI to synthesize information logically (chronologically, by category, etc.)
- Highlights key findings, numbers, and dates

### 4. **Enhanced UI Display**
- Shows comprehensive summaries prominently
- Displays individual search results with organized layout
- Provides progress tracking during multi-search execution
- Maintains compatibility with simple single searches

## Example Use Cases

### Stock Analysis Query
**User Input:** "Stock development for last 3 years on BMW I want to have the ATH for each year"

**Search Plan Created:**
1. "BMW stock price 2022 all time high"
2. "BMW stock price 2023 all time high" 
3. "BMW stock price 2024 all time high"
4. "BMW stock performance last 3 years"

**Result:** Comprehensive summary with ATH data for each year plus overall performance analysis.

### Comparison Query
**User Input:** "Compare Tesla and Ford stock performance"

**Search Plan Created:**
1. "Tesla stock performance 2024"
2. "Ford stock performance 2024"
3. "Tesla vs Ford stock comparison"

**Result:** Side-by-side comparison with key metrics and analysis.

### Simple Query
**User Input:** "Current weather in New York"

**Search Plan:** Single search (no planning needed)

**Result:** Standard weather information display.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### `plan_web_searches()`
- Analyzes query complexity using GPT-4o
- Creates focused search queries (max 5 to avoid overwhelming)
- Handles JSON parsing with fallback text parsing
- Updates state with search plan

#### `execute_search_plan()`
- Executes multiple Tavily searches sequentially
- Provides real-time progress updates
- Handles individual search errors gracefully
- Collects and organizes all results

#### `synthesize_search_results()`
- Uses GPT-4o to create comprehensive summaries
- Organizes information logically
- Highlights key findings and metrics
- Maximum 500 words for conciseness

#### Enhanced `web_search()` Tool
- Automatically detects if planning is needed
- Falls back to single search for simple queries
- Provides detailed progress tracking
- Returns structured results for complex queries

### Frontend Components

#### Enhanced Result Display
- **Comprehensive Summary**: Prominently displays AI-synthesized overview
- **Individual Results**: Shows each search with organized cards
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates during execution
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to single vs. multi-search results

#### State Management
- Added `search_plan` and `search_results` to agent state
- Maintains consistency across state updates
- Supports both simple and complex result structures

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Handles complex queries that previously required multiple manual searches
2. **Better Information Quality**: AI synthesis provides more coherent and actionable insights
3. **Time Savings**: Automated planning and parallel research capabilities
4. **Scalability**: Can handle various query types from simple to complex
5. **Transparency**: Shows the search plan and individual results for verification

## Usage Examples

Users can now ask complex questions like:
- "Compare Apple and Microsoft stock performance over the last 2 years"
- "Get me the GDP growth rates for USA, China, and Germany for 2022-2024"
- "Find the top 3 AI startups that got funding in 2024 and their funding amounts"
- "What are the latest developments in renewable energy technology this year"

The system will automatically plan the appropriate searches, execute them efficiently, and provide a comprehensive synthesized response.
